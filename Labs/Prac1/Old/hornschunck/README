Note to curious people:

You can simply use the code by Enric Meinhardt Llopis (http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2013/20/phs_3.tar.gz) if you understand what you are doing and seeing.

Otherwise do the following:

  1) Compile flow-code just this time

    cd flow-code/imageLib
    make
    cd ..
    make
    cd ..

  2) Compile horn_schunck_classic.c and run the script to test the optical flow

    make
    ./run

  3) Take a look to out.png
